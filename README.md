# ID271
 This is a repository that contains all data packets and codes for ID271 final project -- an analysis of a subset from the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study (NAS), which tracks health data from 2,280 men in the Greater Boston area since 1963. Our subset includes 968 subjects with 2,454 observations.

 The project is a team contribution on all codes and write-up, and it mainly uses a generalized linear regression model to analyze the health impacts of environmental and clinical factors over time to inform public health strategies.
